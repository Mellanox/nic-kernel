	  Support for VGA extension to VFIO PCI.  This exposes an additional
	  region on VGA devices for accessing legacy VGA addresses used by
	  BIOS and generic video drivers.

	  Support for Intel IGD specific extensions to enable direct
	  assignment to virtual machines.  This includes exposing an IGD
	  specific firmware table and read-only copies of the host bridge
	  and LPC bridge config space.

	  To enable Intel IGD assignment through vfio-pci, say Y.

	  To enable s390x KVM vfio-pci extensions, say Y.

	default y
	help
	  Enable support for VFIO PCI extensions that allow exporting
	  device MMIO regions as DMA-BUFs for peer devices to access via
	  peer-to-peer (P2P) DMA.

	  This feature enables a VFIO-managed PCI device to export a portion
	  of its MMIO BAR as a DMA-BUF file descriptor, which can be passed
	  to other userspace drivers or kernel subsystems capable of
	  initiating DMA to that region.

	  Say Y here if you want to enable VFIO DMABUF-based MMIO export
	  support for peer-to-peer DMA use cases.

	  If unsure, say N.
